          1. Questions for "breaking the first ice" in relations with the
          others: How are you? Where are you from? How are you doing in life?
          What do you do in your life? How do you spend your free time? What are
          your hobbies, passions, dreams? Long time no see and talk, how are
          you? How are you? How do you feel? Are you healthy are you happy?
        </p>

          listener. Interest others, and you will seem interesting to them. Ask
          questions like this which the interlocutor will gladly answer.
          Encourage the interlocutor to talk about himself and his
          accomplishments. Talk about what interests you make the interlocutor
          feel important.
        </p>
        <p className={css.text}>
          4. Relationships are more important than achievements. This is what
          will make us happy for the rest of our lives.
